Some small python files

---------------------------------------------------------

# Rock, paper, scissors
<i>Game.py</i><br><br> The classic game. Used: Python 2.7
# The tale of the flaming sword
<i>Game1.py</i> <br>/unfinished, currently I am not working on that./ Used: Python 2.7<br><br>
# Latinizator
<i>latinizator.py</i> <br>This is a small functiuon that translates cyrillic to latin. Used: Python 3.6.0<br><br>
# Latinizator 2
<i>latinizator2.py</i> <br>This is a small functiuon that translates cyrillic to latin. It has a different structure from <i>Latinizator</i>. IT is much smaller and gives the symbols that are not included in the allowed list. Used: Python 3.6.0<br><br> 
# Linker
<i>Linker.py</i> is a script that allows you to give link or some text to the script, it saves it in a .txt file named links.txt and after that you can pull it. The idea is to save multiple links and whe you pull them to mark that they have been used. This is achieved by adding a 1 at the end of the string and when pulled changing the 1 to a 0 so it can't appear twice. The pull request does not work properly at the moment. Used: Python 3.6.0<br><br>
